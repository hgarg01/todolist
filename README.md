# todolist
A Python project that helps you create and maintain a list of things to do. The main menu gives the following options :
1) Today's tasks
2) Week's tasks
3) All tasks
4) Missed tasks
5) Add task
6) Delete task
0) Exit

New tasks can be added and deleted using this menu. The tasks thus added are added permanently to the database.

The menu also gives options to retrieve the list of today's tasks, week's tasks, Missed tasks and all the previous tasks. The menu keeps on giving the options until the option 0 (for Exit) is selected.

The project has been developed in Python.
